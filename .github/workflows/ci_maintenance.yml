          - rust default nightly version (\`ci/rust-toolchain-nightly.toml\`)
          - python version for the python lint (\`.github/workflows/lint.yml\`)
          - tor and tgen versions for the tor tests (\`.github/workflows/extra_tests.yml\`)

          Shadow's dependencies may also need to be updated.
