# This file can be used to pin the rust toolchain to the "nightly" version used by shadow CI.
#
# ```sh
# ln -s ci/rust-toolchain-nightly.toml rust-toolchain.toml
# ```
#
# See
# https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file
#
# After updating this version, it's a good idea to re-build the base images for
# our incremental CI tests (.github/workflows/run_tests_incremental.yml), so
# that the newly specified version is baked in and doesn't have to be installed
# (and rust deps rebuilt) during every incremental build.

# Must be a version built with miri; check

channel = "nightly-2023-05-31"
# We don't add individual components here. CI individually
# adds the ones they need (e.g. clippy, miri).
