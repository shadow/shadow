The Shadow Simulator <shadow-support@cs.umn.edu>

Shadow is a unique discrete-event network simulator that runs real 
applications like Tor and Bitcoin, and distributed systems of thousands of
nodes on a single machine. Shadow combines the accuracy of emulation with the 
efficiency and control of simulation, achieving the best of both approaches.

Also included are simple Internet topologies and a core plug-in for generating
traffic between nodes and through SOCKS proxies.

Quick Setup (installs everything in ~/.shadow):
    $ ./setup build --clean --debug
    $ ./setup install
