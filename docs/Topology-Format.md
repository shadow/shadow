## Topology Description

The topology files included in Shadow were generated from a variety of data sources, including [Net Index](http://www.netindex.com/), and [CAIDA](). The data is represented in a standard graphml format so that it is easy to swap out specific measurements of latency, jitter, packetloss, etc, if desired. See [our Tor modeling paper](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~jansen/papers/tormodel-cset2012.pdf) for more details.

_TODO_: describe PoIs, PoPs, the various hints and how they are used in the topology, the method for assigning hosts to network vertices, routing, etc.

## Topology Format

_TODO_: graphml, igraph, etc.
