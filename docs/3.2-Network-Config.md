Shadow uses a graphml format to represent a network topology. The python module [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) can be used to manipulate such a format. Shadow is distributed with some graphml topology files that were generated using data from a variety of sources. Because the topology is represented in a standard graphml format, it is easy to swap out specific measurements of latency, jitter, packetloss, etc, if desired.

### Vertices

In addition to the default _id_ attribute, all vertices must have the _bandwidthup_ and _bandwidthdown_ attributes (given in KiB/s). Optional vertex attributes include _ip_, _citycode_, _countrycode_, and _packetloss_.

You can control where hosts in your Shadow experiment get attached to the topology by setting the _iphint_, _citycodehint_, and _countrycodehint_ in your host attribute list in the Shadow config file. Hosts are always attached to the closest match to the best vertex following the hinted restrictions. See [3.1-Shadow-Config.md](3.1-Shadow-Config.md) for more details.

### Edges

In addition to the default _source_ and _target_ attributes, all edges must have the _latency_, and _packetloss_ attributes. These are used when computing paths and routing packets between virtual hosts.

### Routing

If the topology is a complete graph, Shadow uses the single link between each vertex as the path. Otherwise, a routing path is approximated using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

### Example

The following is an example of a properly-formed graphml file for Shadow:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd">
  <key attr.name="packetloss" attr.type="double" for="edge" id="d6" />
  <key attr.name="latency" attr.type="double" for="edge" id="d5" />
  <key attr.name="packetloss" attr.type="double" for="node" id="d4" />
  <key attr.name="countrycode" attr.type="string" for="node" id="d3" />
  <key attr.name="bandwidthdown" attr.type="int" for="node" id="d2" />
  <key attr.name="bandwidthup" attr.type="int" for="node" id="d1" />
  <key attr.name="ip" attr.type="string" for="node" id="d0" />
  <graph edgedefault="undirected">
    <node id="poi-1">
      <data key="d0">0.0.0.0</data>
      <data key="d1">2251</data>
      <data key="d2">17038</data>
      <data key="d3">US</data>
      <data key="d4">0.0</data>
    </node>
    <edge source="poi-1" target="poi-1">
      <data key="d5">50.0</data>
      <data key="d6">0.001</data>
    </edge>
  </graph>
</graphml>
```

### Generating new topologies

You can generate realistic Internet topologies for Shadow using [the atlas tool](http://github.com/shadow/atlas).
