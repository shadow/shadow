Shadow uses a standard XML format to accept configuration options from users, and uses [GLib's XML parser](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Simple-XML-Subset-Parser.html) to parse the simple structure. Examples of a Shadow configuration file, `shadow.config.xml`, are distributed with the release. The following describes valid XML elements and attributes that Shadow will accept from a `shadow.config.xml` file and that can be used to customize a simulation.

### The _shadow_ element
```xml
<shadow stoptime="INTEGER" preload="STRING" environment="STRING" />
```
**Required attribute**: _stoptime_  
**Optional attributes**: _preload_, _environment_  

The _stoptime_ attribute represents the number of virtual seconds to simulate, after which the experiment will be killed and resources released.

The _preload_ attribute is used to configure the path to the Shadow preload library (`libshadow-interpose.so`) that Shadow uses for function interposition. This path is optional, however, the path to the preload library must be given either here in the Shadow config file, at run time using the `--preload` command line option, or in the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.

The _environment_ attribute is used to set various environment variables for use during Shadow execution, such as `LD_PRELOAD=/home/rob/.shadow/lib/libshadow-interpose.so`. Multiple variables can be specified by using a semicolon separator (`;`). For example, the Tor plug-in uses the following environment string: 

```
environment="OPENSSL_ia32cap=~0x200000200000000;EVENT_NOSELECT=1;EVENT_NOPOLL=1;EVENT_NOKQUEUE=1;EVENT_NODEVPOLL=1;EVENT_NOEVPORT=1;EVENT_NOWIN32=1"
```

### The _topology_ element
```xml
<topology path="STRING" />
```
**Required attributes**:  
**Optional attributes**: _path_  
**Optional child element**: `<![CDATA[TEXT]]>`

The _topology_ element must hold either a collection of vertices and edges that represent a network topology as the TEXT in a `<![CDATA[TEXT]]>` style element, or a _path_ to a file holding such data. The TEXT data should be in graphml format, and hold an undirected, complete, connected graph with certain attributes specified on the vertices and links. For more information on how to structure this data, see the [Topology Format](3.2-Network-Config).

### The _plugin_ element
```xml
<plugin id="STRING" path="STRING" />
```
**Required attributes**: _id_, _path_  

The _plugin_ element represents a library plug-in that Shadow should dynamically load, or a preload library that Shadow should use for function interposition for a set of hosts. The _id_ attribute identifies this _plugin_ and must be a string that is unique among all _id_ attributes for any element in the XML file. 

The _path_ attribute holds the system path to the plug-in `*.so` library. If _path_ begins with `~/`, the path will be considered relative to the current user's home directory.

Preload plug-ins are used in the _process_ element and provides a way to interpose on any virtual process running in Shadow.

### The _host_ element
```xml
<host id="STRING" iphint="STRING" geocodehint="STRING" typehint="STRING" quantity="INTEGER" bandwidthdown="INTEGER" bandwidthup="INTEGER" interfacebuffer="INTEGER" socketrecvbuffer="INTEGER" socketsendbuffer="INTEGER" loglevel="STRING" heartbeatloglevel="STRING" heartbeatloginfo="STRING" heartbeatfrequency="INTEGER" cpufrequency="INTEGER" logpcap="STRING" pcapdir="STRING">
  <process ... />
  ...
</host>
```
**Required attributes**: _id_  
**Optional attributes**: _iphint_, _geocodehint_, _typehint_, _quantity_, _bandwidthdown_, _bandwidthup_, _interfacebuffer_, _socketrecvbuffer_, _socketsendbuffer_, _loglevel_, _heartbeatloglevel_, _heartbeatloginfo_, _heartbeatfrequency_, _cpufrequency_, _logpcap_, _pcapdir_  
**Required child element**: \<process\>  

The _host_ element represents a node or virtual host in the simulation. The _id_ attribute identifies this _host_ and must be a string that is unique among all _id_ attributes for any element in the XML file. _id_ will also be used as the network hostname of this _host_.

The _iphint_, _geocodehint_, and _typehint_ attributes provide hints to Shadow's name and routing system on where to attach this host to the topology. These hints will be matched based on the values of the _ip_, _geocode_, and _type_ of the vertices as specified in the topology file.

The _quantity_ attribute specifies the number of hosts of this type to start. If _quantity_ is greater than 1, each host's hostname will be prefixed with a counter. For example, a _host_ with an _id_ of `host` and _quantity_=2 would produce nodes with hostnames `1.host` and `2.host`.

_bandwidthdown_ and _bandwidthup_ optionally specify the downstream and upstream bandwidth capacities for this _host_, and override any default bandwidth values set in the _cluster_ element corresponding to the _cluster_ attribute. If not given, the default bandwidth values from the assigned _cluster_ element are used.

_interfacebuffer_ controls the size of the interface receive buffer that accepts packets from the network. _socketrecvbuffer_ and _socketsendbuffer_ control the initial size of the socket buffers that hold packets to and from the process. Note that these sizes may be adjusted by auto-tuning, in order fill the channel capacity as defined by the bandwidth-delay product between two hosts. These values can instead be set globally for all hosts with the Shadow command line options `--interface-buffer`, `--socket-recv-buffer`, and `--socket-send-buffer` (see `shadow --help-network` for more info).

_loglevel_ and _heartbeatloglevel_ are host-specific overrides for the simulator default log levels (the defaults are adjustable with shadow arguments `--log-level` and `--heartbeat-log-level`). Valid strings include 'error', 'critical', 'warning', 'message', 'info', and 'debug'. _heartbeatloginfo_ is a host-specific override for the type of information that will get logged for this node during the heartbeat. Valid values are 'node', 'socket', and 'ram'. _heartbeatfrequency_ is a host-specific override for the default number of seconds between which heartbeat messages are logged (the default is adjustable with shadow argument `--heartbeat-frequency`). Each heartbeat message contains useful statistics about the _node_.

_cpufrequency_ is the speed of this _host's_ virtual CPU in kilohertz. Along with the CPU processing requirements of the plug-in process, this determines how often events for this _host_ are delayed during simulation.

_logpcap_ is a case insensitive boolean string (e.g. "true") that specifies that Shadow should log all network input and output for this _node_ in PCAP format (for viewing in e.g. wireshark). _pcapdir_ is the directory to which the logs should be saved for this _host_.

Hosts must have at least one child \<process\> (see below), and may have more than one.

### The _process_ element
```xml
<process plugin="STRING" preload="STRING" starttime="INTEGER" stoptime="INTEGER" arguments="STRING" />
```
**Required attributes**: _plugin_, _starttime_, _arguments_  
**Optional attributes**: _preload_, _stoptime_  
**Required parent element**: \<host\>

The _process_ element represents a virtual software process that the host will run. The _plugin_ attribute should be set to the _id_ of the _plugin_ element that represents the plug-in that should be used to launch this process at _starttime_ virtual seconds from the beginning of the simulation. The process will be stopped at _stoptime_ virtual seconds if given.

The _arguments_ attribute should be set to a string holding the required plug-in arguments. This string will be passed to the plug-in in an `argv`-style array, similar to how arguments are passed to the main function in a `C` program. Please see the plug-in documentation for usage and format of the argument string.

The _preload_ attribute may be used to specify an _id_ of a _plugin_ element that should be used to interpose symbol lookups for this process. If a symbol that is called by the _process_ exists in the _preload_ library, the _preload_ library version will be called instead of the usual version.
