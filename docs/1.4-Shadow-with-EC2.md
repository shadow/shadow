This page describes how to use Shadow on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2); this installation method is optional.

The cloud images available on EC2 are outdated. If using EC2, it is recommended that you create a fresh instance and follow the latest [Shadow setup instructions](https://github.com/shadow/shadow/wiki/1.1-Shadow).

## Elastic Compute Cloud

Amazon’s [Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) infrastructure provides a simple and relatively [cost-efficient](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing) way to run large-scale Shadow experiments without the need to buy expensive hardware or manage complex configurations. You can get started running Shadow experiments on EC2 in minutes using our pre-configured public EC2 AMI, which has already been set up to run Shadow.

1. Sign up for [Amazon EC2 access](https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration)
1. Launch an instance using our pre-installed and configured [Shadow-cloud AMI (ami-0f70c366)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#launchAmi=ami-0f70c366) based on Ubuntu LTS releases
1. Follow the New Instance Wizard
   + the **instance type** you’ll need depends on what size Shadow network you’ll want to simulate (see [the shadow-plugin-tor wiki](https://github.com/shadow/shadow-plugin-tor) for scalability estimates)
   + create and download a new **keypair** if you don’t already have one, since you’ll need it for SSH access
   + create a new **security group** for the Shadow-cloud server
   + configure the **firewall** to allow inbound SSH on 0.0.0.0/0
1. Once the instance is launched and ready, find the public DNS info and remotely log into the machine using the keypair you downloaded:
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-public-dns.amazonaws.com
```
1. Once logged in, view `~/README` and `~/shadow-git-clone/README` for more information
