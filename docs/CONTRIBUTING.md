## Contributing

For trivial fixes (e.g. fixing typos or bugs spanning only a few
lines), feel free to send a pull request with your changes.  For
anything bigger than that, it's best to talk to us first.

If you have a specific improvement you'd like to contribute to
Shadow, the best way to get started is to file an issue or comment on
an existing one. You can save wasted work this way by ensuring we
have agreement on whether you're planned improvement and design for
that improvement fits into the roadmap for Shadow, and won't conflict
with other on-going development.

If you haven't already, it's worth going through the [general
documentation](README.md) to get started with building and using
Shadow.

When you're ready to start coding, please take a look at our [Coding
style](coding-style.md) and [Version control](version-control.md)
guidelines.
