**Project Title:** Expanding Research Frontiers with a Next-Generation Anonymous Communication Experimentation (ACE) Framework

**Project Period:** October 1, 2019 - September 30, ~~2022~~ 2023 (extended)

**Abstract:** [NSF Award Abstract #1925497](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925497)

The goal of this project is to develop a scalable and mature deterministic
network simulator, capable of quickly and accurately simulating large networks
such as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org). This project builds on [the Shadow
Simulator](https://shadow.github.io/).

## NSF Project Overview

ACE will be developed with the following features:

 * **Application Emulation.** Learning from the community’s experience, ACE will
   directly execute software and run applications as normal operating system
   processes. By supporting the general execution of applications (i.e.,
   anything that can be executed as a process: network servers, web browsers,
   scripts, etc.), ACE will support software independent of the programming
   language chosen by developers, and ACE will maximize its applicability to a
   large range of evaluation approaches that CISE researchers choose to utilize.
   As a result, ACE will be well-suited to website fingerprinting and censorship
   circumvention research focus areas, which typically require running a variety
   of tools written in a variety of languages.
 * **Network Simulation.** ACE will feature a light-weight network simulation
   component that will allow applications to communicate with each other through
   the ACE framework rather than over the Internet. ACE will simulate common
   transport protocols, such as TCP and UDP. ACE will also simulate virtual
   network routers and other network path components between end-hosts, and
   support evaluation under dynamic changes to timing, congestion, latency,
   bandwidth, network location, and network path elements. Therefore, ACE will
   support both network-aware and location-aware anonymous communication
   research and allow researchers to continue to advance this research agenda in
   current and future Internet architectures.
 * **Function Interposition.** ACE will utilize function interposition in order
   to connect the processes being run by the operating system to the core
   network simulation component. ACE will support an API of common system calls
   that are used to, e.g., send and receive data to and from the network.
   Therefore, all processes executed in ACE will be isolated from the Internet
   and connected through ACE’s simulated network, and the simulation component
   will drive process execution.
 * **Controlled, Deterministic Execution.** ACE features a deterministic
   discrete-event engine, and will therefore control time and operate in
   simulated timescales. As a result, ACE will be disconnected from the
   computational abilities of the host machine: ACE will run
   as-fast-as-possible, which could be faster or slower than real time depending
   on experiment load. ACE is deterministic so that research results can be
   independently and identically reproduced and verified across research labs.
 * **Parallel and Distributed Execution.** ACE will rely on the operating system
   kernel to run and manage processes. Operating system kernels have been
   optimized for this task, and ACE will benefit in terms of better performance
   and a smaller code base. Moreover, ACE will be embarrassingly parallel: the
   Linux kernel generally scales to millions of processes that can be run in
   parallel, and we will design ACE such that any number of processes can be
   executed across multiple distinct machines. Therefore, ACE will scale to
   realistically-sized anonymous communication networks containing millions of
   virtual hosts, and can be deployed on whatever existing infrastructure is
   available at community members' institutions.

As part of the ACE framework, we will also develop a **user interface** to
control and monitor the experimental process, a **toolkit** to help users set up
and configure experiments (including network, mobility, and traffic
characteristics and models) and to visualize results, and a **data repository**
where researchers can share and archive experimental results.

## Project Goals/Activities

Here we outline some high level tasks that we are completing or plan to complete
under this project. We are using Github for project development, including for
tracking progress on major milestones and development tasks. We provide an
outline of our agenda here, and link to the appropriate Github page where
appropriate. Tasks without corresponding Github links means we don't yet have
progress to share at this time.

 * **Task 0: Investigate Architectural Improvements**
   * Build prototype of a process-based simulation architecture -
     [milestone](https://github.com/shadow/shadow/milestone/16)
   * Evaluate and compare against a plugin-based simulation architecture
   * Decide which architecture is right for ACE

 * **Task 1: Develop Core ACE System**
   * Improve test coverage and infrastructure - [shadow
     milestone](https://github.com/shadow/shadow/milestone/15),
     [shadow-plugin-tor
     milestone](https://github.com/shadow/shadow-plugin-tor/milestone/1)
   * Enable new code to be written in Rust -
     [milestone](https://github.com/shadow/shadow/milestone/17)
   * Improve consistency of simulation options and configuration
   * Improve maintainability and accuracy of TCP implementation -
     [milestone](https://github.com/shadow/shadow/milestone/18)
   * Simplify event scheduler, implement continuous event execution model
   * Build a distributed core simulation engine
   * Develop CPU usage model to ensure virtual process CPU utilization consumes
     simulation time

 * **Task 2: Develop User Interface and Visualizations**
   * Design control protocol and API for interacting with Shadow
   * Specify/document protocol
   * Develop user interface that uses the control API
   * Improve tools for analyzing and understanding simulation results

 * **Task 3: Develop Simulation Models for ACE**
   * Improve tools for generating and configuring private Tor networks
   * Improve tools for generating and configuring background traffic models
   * Improve tools for modeling Internet paths and latency
   * Develop support for mobile hosts
   * Create realistic host mobility models

 * **Task 4: Engage Community**
   * Create data repository where users can share configs and results
   * Create user outreach material and surveys to collect feedback
   * Improve user documentation and usage instructions

Over all tasks, we plan to significantly improve documentation, test coverage,
and code maintainability.
