## Tagging Shadow releases

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and increment version
numbers with the [bumpversion](https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/) tool.

The following commands can be used to tag a new version of Shadow, after which
an archive will be available on github's [releases
page](https://github.com/shadow/shadow/releases).

Install bumpversion if needed:

    python3 -m venv bumpenv
    source bumpenv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip
    pip install bumpversion

Make sure main is up to date:

    git checkout main
    git pull

The bumpversion command is run like this (it is recommended to add
`--dry-run --verbose` until you are confident in the result):

    bumpversion --dry-run --verbose <major|minor|patch|release|build>

Decide which part of the version you are bumping. Our format is
`{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{release}.{build}`. Bumping earlier parts of the
version will cause later parts to get reset to 0 (or 'pre' for the release
part). For example, if you are at `2.0.0`, going to `2.1.0-pre` is easy:

    bumpversion minor --tag --commit

In the above case, we can just tag and commit immediately. But if you are going
from `2.0.0` to `2.1.0`, you'll need to either run twice (first to bump the
minor from 0 to 2, then to bump the release from 'pre' to the invisible
'stable'):

    bumpversion minor
    bumpversion --allow-dirty release --commit --tag

or use the serialize option to specify the intended format of the next version:

    bumpversion minor --serialize '{major}.{minor}.{patch}'

Now check that things worked and get the new version number:

    git log -1 --stat
    git describe --tags
    VERSION=`awk -F "=" '/current_version/ {print $2}' .bumpversion.cfg | tr -d ' '`

Update the Cargo lock file, then ammend the commit and tag to include the update
(closely check and update the `Bump version: from â†’ to` messages as needed):

    (cd src && cargo update --workspace)
    git add src/Cargo.lock
    git commit --amend
    git tag -f -a "v$VERSION"

Check again:

    git log -1 --stat
    git describe --tags

Now if everything looks good, push to GitHub:

    git push origin "v$VERSION"

Our releases will then be tagged off of the main branch.

You probably want to also reset the `CHANGELOG.md` file in a new commit after
tagging/pushing the release.
