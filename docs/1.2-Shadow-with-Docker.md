This page describes how to set up Shadow using Docker; this installation method is optional.

**Warning:** This documentation is for an older version of Shadow. Please use only as a reference, and follow the instructions in the [installation document](1.1-Shadow.md).

## Building your own docker image

There are many ways to do this.  Below, we base our install off of Fedora 32.

1. Get the Fedora repository via `docker pull fedora` This may take a few minutes.
1. Start a container via `docker run -i -t fedora:32 --shm-size=1g /bin/bash`. The `--shm-size` option sets the size of the `/dev/shm` mount point within the container.
1. Create a non-root user:

	```bash
	useradd -s /bin/bash -g wheel shadow
	dnf install -y passwd sudo
	passwd shadow  # when asked, set the password to something sensible
	```

1. Install Shadow's dependencies and recommended tools (this may take a few minutes):

	```bash
	dnf update -y
	dnf install -y cmake make gcc gcc-c++ glib2 glib2-devel igraph igraph-devel xz xz-devel procps-devel python3
	dnf install -y numpy python-scipy python-lxml python-matplotlib python-networkx
	dnf install -y git dstat screen htop
	```

1. Become the shadow user: `sudo -u shadow -s`
1. Change to the shadow user's home directory: `cd`
1. Install Shadow:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/shadow/shadow.git
	cd shadow
	./setup build --test
	./setup install
	./setup test
	```

1. You should add `/home/${USER}/.shadow/bin` to your shell setup for the PATH environment variable (e.g., in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`).

	```bash
	echo "export PATH=${PATH}:/home/${USER}/.shadow/bin" >> ~/.bashrc && bash
	```

1. (Optional) Install shadow-plugin-tor:
  + install the dependencies:

		```bash
		sudo dnf install -y gcc automake autoconf zlib zlib-devel gpg tar
		```

 + compile and build shadow-plugin-tor:

		```bash
		git clone https://github.com/shadow/shadow-plugin-tor.git
		cd shadow-plugin-tor
		./setup dependencies	# answer prompts
		./setup build	        # answer prompts
		./setup install
		```

1. Save the image:
  + First, note the name of your container.  You can find this via running `docker ps` **from another terminal** or, more simply, by looking at the prompt.  For example, if the prompt reads: `[shadow@fffe28725f3f shadow]$`, then your container name is *fffe28725f3f*.
  + Exit both the shadow user's and root's shells via:

		```bash
		exit
		exit
		# possibly run exit a third time if you ran bash during step 8 above
		```

  + Commit the image via `docker commit fffe28725f3f shadow-standalone`

You're done!  

If you want to create a new container using your new image, do:

	```bash
	docker run -t -i -u shadow shadow-standalone --shm-size=1g /bin/bash
	```

If shadow isn't in your path, re-run the command from step 8.
