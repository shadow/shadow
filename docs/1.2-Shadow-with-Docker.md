This page describes how to set up Shadow using Docker; this installation method is optional.

## Pre-built images
A docker image that includes just Shadow (release v1.10.2) is available at [https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/shadow-docker-images/shadow-standalone.tar.gz](https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/shadow-docker-images/shadow-standalone.tar.gz).  

An image that includes Shadow along with the Tor plugin is available at [https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/shadow-docker-images/shadow-tor.tar.gz](https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/shadow-docker-images/shadow-tor.tar.gz).

To use these images:

1. Download the desired image (see above URLs).
2. Load it via: ```gunzip -c shadow-standalone.tar.gz | docker load```
3. Run it via: ```docker run -t -i -u shadow shadow-standalone /bin/bash```

(Replace *shadow-standalone* with *shadow-tor* if you are using the image with the Tor plugin.)

The **shadow** user has sudo access.  Its password is ***shadow***.

Remember to save your modifications!  See the fine [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) for more information about how to use containers and images.


## Building your own docker image

There are many ways to do this.  Below, we base our install off of Fedora 22.

1. Get the Fedora repository via ```docker pull fedora``` This may take a few minutes.
1. Start a container via ```docker run -i -t fedora:22 /bin/bash```
1. Create a non-root user: 

	```bash
	useradd -s /bin/bash -g wheel shadow
	dnf install -y passwd sudo
	passwd shadow			# set it to something sensible
	```
1. Install Shadow's dependencies (this may take a few minutes):

	```bash
	dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ clang clang-devel llvm llvm-devel glib2 glib2-devel 	igraph igraph-devel cmake make xz
	dnf install -y python numpy scipy python-matplotlib python-networkx python-lxml
	dnf install -y git dstat screen htop```

1. Become the shadow user: ```sudo -u shadow -s```
1. Change to the shadow user's home directory: ```cd```
1. Install Shadow:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/shadow/shadow.git
	cd shadow
	./setup build
	./setup install
	```
1. You should add `/home/${USER}/.shadow/bin` to your shell setup for the PATH environment variable (e.g., in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`).

	```bash
	echo "export PATH=${PATH}:/home/${USER}/.shadow/bin" >> ~/.bashrc && bash
	```
1. (Optional) Install shadow-plugin-tor:
  + install the dependencies:
  
  	```bash
  	sudo dnf install -y gcc automake autoconf zlib zlib-devel gpg tar
 	```
 + compile and build shadow-plugin-tor:
 
 	```bash
 	git clone https://github.com/shadow/shadow-plugin-tor.git
	cd shadow-plugin-tor
	./setup dependencies	# answer prompts
	./setup build	        # answer prompts
	./setup install
	```
1. Save the image:
  + First, note the name of your container.  You can find this via running ```docker ps``` **from another terminal** or, more simply, by looking at the prompt.  For example, if the prompt reads: ```[shadow@fffe28725f3f shadow]$```, then your container name is *fffe28725f3f*.
  + Exit both the shadow user's and root's shells via

	 ```bash
  	 exit
	 exit
	 # possibly run exit a third time if you ran bash during step 8 above
    ```
  + Commit the image via ```docker commit fffe28725f3f shadow-standalone```

You're done!  

If you want to create a new container using your new image, do:

```bash
docker run -t -i -u shadow shadow-standalone /bin/bash
```

If shadow isn't in your path, re-run the command from step 8.
