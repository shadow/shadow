"""
Reads the output of bindgen on `stdin`, and writes a mangled version to `stdout`.

In particular this is meant to be run on the output of running `bindgen` over
the Linux kernel headers. Types, constant names, and field names are prefixed
with `linux_`, `LINUX_`, or `l_`. This mangling makes the output safe to be
exported back out to C via cbindgen without causing conflicts with libc or
kernel headers.

# Caveats

The Rust code parsing here is primitive. It should be ok for the output
of bindgen, but for example wouldn't understand that a span inside
quotes is a string instead of code.
