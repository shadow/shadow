//! Type definitions and utilities for interacting with the Linux API.
//! Does not depend on the `std` crate (i.e. is `no_std`) nor libc.
//!
//! We currently re-export C bindings. This allows normal C code, using
//! libc headers, to work with these kernel types. Normally this can't be done
//! because the libc and kernel headers contain incompatible definitions.
//!
//! # Type names
//!
//! We provide 3 styles of types:
//!
//! * snake-cased-types prefixed with `linux_`. These are ABI-compatible with
//!   the corresponding kernel types. These types are re-exported in this crate's
//!   generated C header, and are the types used in exported C function APIs.
//!
//! * snake-cased-types *without* the `linux_` prefix. These are *also* ABI-compatible
//!   with the corresponding kernel types, and are intended for use in Rust
//!   code.  They never require or enforce invariants beyond that bytes are
//!   initialized, so are safe to transmute from initialized bytes, or from the
//!   corresponding `linux_` type if the required bytes are known to be
//!   initialized. See [`crate::signal::sigaction`] for an example of a type
//!   with such invariants.
//!
//!   We do *not* expose these types in C interfaces, since they have the same
//!   name as types in the original Linux headers, and often with the same name
//!   in C library headers. Exported C APIs should use the `linux_` types in their
//!   signatures, and convert internally to the non-prefixed types. In cases
//!   where the 2 types are not simply aliased, they usually implement
//!   `bytemuck::TransparentWrapper` or similar APIs that allow converting
//!   values *and references* in both directions.
//!
//! * camel-cased types are *not* necessarily bitwise-compatible with kernel types
//!   with similar names. These primarily include `enum`s and `bitflags` types.
//!   Kernel constants such as `O_WRONLY` are typically defined as instants of
//!   such types, and are convertible to and from the original integer types.
