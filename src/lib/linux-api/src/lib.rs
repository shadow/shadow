//! Type definitions and utilities for interacting with the Linux API.
//! Does not depend on the `std` crate (i.e. is `no_std`) nor libc.
//!
//! We currently re-export C bindings. This allows normal C code, using
//! libc headers, to work with these kernel types. Normally this can't be done
//! because the libc and kernel headers contain incompatible definitions.
//!
//! To support this use-case, we prefix most names with `Linux` or `linux_`
//! as appropriate, so that the re-exported types don't conflict with the libc
//! types that would otherwise have the same names.
