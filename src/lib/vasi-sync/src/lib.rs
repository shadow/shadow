//! VirtualAddressSpaceIndependent synchronization primitives.
//!
//! This is a collection of synchronization primitives intended for use in
//! shared memory, which may be mapped into different processes, potentially at
//! different virtual addresses - see the [`vasi::VirtualAddressSpaceIndependent`]
//! trait for details.
//!
//! In contrast, the synchronization primitives in the `std` crate may or may
//! not work in this scenario; they are intended primarily to synchronize
//! threads within a single virtual address space. e.g. they may use `Box`
//! internally.
//!
//! This module contains tests that are designed to work with [loom].  See
//! [loom] documentation for full details, but a basic way to run these under
//! loom, from the shadow source directory is:
//!
//! ```shell
//! LOOM_MAX_PREEMPTIONS=3 \
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" \
//! cargo test \
//! --manifest-path=src/Cargo.toml \
//! -p vasi-sync \
//! --target-dir=loomtarget \
//! -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Setting `--target-dir` avoids thrashing the build cache back and forth
//! between a loom build or not.
//!
//! In case of failure, see the loom documentation for guidance on debugging.
//! In particular LOOM_LOG=trace and/or LOOM_LOCATIONS=1 are a good place to start.
//!
