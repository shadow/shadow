Usage: shadow [OPTIONS] [CONFIG]

Arguments:
  [CONFIG]  Path to the Shadow configuration file. Use '-' to read from stdin

Options:
      --debug-hosts <hostnames>  Pause after starting any processes on the comma-delimited list of
                                 hostnames
  -g, --gdb                      Pause to allow gdb to attach
  -h, --help                     Print help (see more with '--help')
      --shm-cleanup              Exit after running shared memory cleanup routine
      --show-build-info          Exit after printing build information
      --show-config              Exit after printing the final configuration
  -V, --version                  Print version

General (Override configuration file options):
      --bootstrap-end-time <seconds>
          The simulated time that ends Shadow's high network bandwidth/reliability bootstrap period
          [default: "0 sec"]
  -d, --data-directory <path>
          Path to store simulation output [default: "shadow.data"]
  -e, --template-directory <path>
          Path to recursively copy during startup and use as the data-directory [default: null]
      --heartbeat-interval <seconds>
          Interval at which to print heartbeat messages [default: "1 sec"]
  -l, --log-level <level>
          Log level of output written on stdout. If Shadow was built in release mode, then log
          messages at level 'trace' will always be dropped [default: "info"]
      --model-unblocked-syscall-latency <bool>
          Model syscalls and VDSO functions that don't block as having some latency. This should
          have minimal effect on typical simulations, but can be helpful for programs with "busy
          loops" that otherwise deadlock under Shadow. [default: false]
  -p, --parallelism <cores>
          How many parallel threads to use to run the simulation. A value of 0 will allow Shadow to
          choose the number of threads. [default: 0]
      --progress <bool>
          Show the simulation progress on stderr [default: false]
      --seed <N>
          Initialize randomness using seed N [default: 1]
      --stop-time <seconds>
          The simulated time at which simulated processes are sent a SIGKILL signal

Network (Override network options):
      --use-shortest-path <bool>  When routing packets, follow the shortest path rather than
                                  following a direct edge between nodes. If false, the network graph
                                  is required to be complete. [default: true]

Host Defaults (Default options for hosts):
      --host-log-level <level>     Log level at which to print node messages [default: null]
      --pcap-capture-size <bytes>  How much data to capture per packet (header and payload) if pcap
                                   logging is enabled [default: "65535 B"]
      --pcap-enabled <bool>        Should shadow generate pcap files? [default: false]

If units are not specified, all values are assumed to be given in their base unit (seconds, bytes,
bits, etc). Units can optionally be specified (for example: '1024 B', '1024 bytes', '1 KiB', '1
kibibyte', etc) and are case-sensitive.
