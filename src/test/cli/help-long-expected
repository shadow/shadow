Usage: shadow [OPTIONS] [CONFIG]

Arguments:
  [CONFIG]
          Path to the Shadow configuration file. Use '-' to read from stdin

Options:
      --debug-hosts <hostnames>
          Pause after starting any processes on the comma-delimited list of hostnames

  -g, --gdb
          Pause to allow gdb to attach

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

      --shm-cleanup
          Exit after running shared memory cleanup routine

      --show-build-info
          Exit after printing build information

      --show-config
          Exit after printing the final configuration

  -V, --version
          Print version

General (Override configuration file options):
      --bootstrap-end-time <seconds>
          The simulated time that ends Shadow's high network bandwidth/reliability bootstrap period
          [default: "0 sec"]

  -d, --data-directory <path>
          Path to store simulation output [default: "shadow.data"]

  -e, --template-directory <path>
          Path to recursively copy during startup and use as the data-directory [default: null]

      --heartbeat-interval <seconds>
          Interval at which to print heartbeat messages [default: "1 sec"]

  -l, --log-level <level>
          Log level of output written on stdout. If Shadow was built in release mode, then log
          messages at level 'trace' will always be dropped [default: "info"]

      --model-unblocked-syscall-latency <bool>
          Model syscalls and VDSO functions that don't block as having some latency. This should
          have minimal effect on typical simulations, but can be helpful for programs with "busy
          loops" that otherwise deadlock under Shadow. [default: false]

  -p, --parallelism <cores>
          How many parallel threads to use to run the simulation. A value of 0 will allow Shadow to
          choose the number of threads. [default: 0]

      --progress <bool>
          Show the simulation progress on stderr [default: false]

      --seed <N>
          Initialize randomness using seed N [default: 1]

      --stop-time <seconds>
          The simulated time at which simulated processes are sent a SIGKILL signal

Network (Override network options):
      --use-shortest-path <bool>
          When routing packets, follow the shortest path rather than following a direct edge between
          nodes. If false, the network graph is required to be complete. [default: true]

Host Defaults (Default options for hosts):
      --host-log-level <level>
          Log level at which to print node messages [default: null]

      --pcap-capture-size <bytes>
          How much data to capture per packet (header and payload) if pcap logging is enabled
          [default: "65535 B"]

      --pcap-enabled <bool>
          Should shadow generate pcap files? [default: false]

Experimental (Unstable and may change or be removed at any time, regardless of Shadow version):
      --edge-bandwidth-algorithm <name>
          Rate-limiting algorithm when edge bandwidth limiting is enabled. Currently supported:
          token_bucket [default: "token-bucket"]

      --edge-bandwidth-burst-ratio <ratio>
          Burst ratio for token bucket algorithm when edge bandwidth limiting is enabled. [default:
          1.5]

      --edge-bandwidth-limiting-enabled <bool>
          Enable experimental per-edge bandwidth limiting. When false (default), any edge bandwidth
          attributes in the network graph are ignored. [default: false]

      --interface-qdisc <mode>
          The queueing discipline to use at the network interface [default: "fifo"]

      --max-unapplied-cpu-latency <seconds>
          Max amount of execution-time latency allowed to accumulate before the clock is moved
          forward. Moving the clock forward is a potentially expensive operation, so larger values
          reduce simulation overhead, at the cost of coarser time jumps. Note also that
          accumulated-but-unapplied latency is discarded when a thread is blocked on a syscall.
          [default: "1 μs"]

      --native-preemption-enabled <bool>
          When true, and when managed code runs for an extended time without returning control to
          shadow (e.g. by making a syscall), shadow preempts the managed code and moves simulated
          time forward. This can be used to escape "pure-CPU busy-loops", but isn't usually needed,
          breaks simulation determinism, and significantly affects simulation performance. [default:
          false]

      --native-preemption-native-interval <seconds>
          When `native_preemption_enabled` is true, amount of native CPU-time to wait before
          preempting managed code that hasn't returned control to shadow. Only supports microsecond
          granularity, and values below 1 microsecond are rejected. [default: "100 ms"]

      --native-preemption-sim-interval <seconds>
          When `native_preemption_enabled` is true, amount of simulated time to consume after
          `native_preemption_native_interval` has elapsed without returning control to shadow.
          [default: "10 ms"]

      --report-errors-to-stderr <bool>
          When true, report error-level messages to stderr in addition to logging to stdout.
          [default: true]

      --runahead <seconds>
          If set, overrides the automatically calculated minimum time workers may run ahead when
          sending events between nodes [default: "1 ms"]

      --scheduler <name>
          The host scheduler implementation, which decides how to assign hosts to threads and
          threads to CPU cores [default: "thread-per-core"]

      --socket-recv-autotune <bool>
          Enable receive window autotuning [default: true]

      --socket-recv-buffer <bytes>
          Initial size of the socket's receive buffer [default: "174760 B"]

      --socket-send-autotune <bool>
          Enable send window autotuning [default: true]

      --socket-send-buffer <bytes>
          Initial size of the socket's send buffer [default: "131072 B"]

      --strace-logging-mode <mode>
          Log the syscalls for each process to individual "strace" files [default: "off"]

      --unblocked-syscall-latency <seconds>
          Simulated latency of an unblocked syscall. For efficiency Shadow only actually adds this
          latency if and when `max_unapplied_cpu_latency` is reached. [default: "1 μs"]

      --unblocked-vdso-latency <seconds>
          Simulated latency of a vdso "syscall". For efficiency Shadow only actually adds this
          latency if and when `max_unapplied_cpu_latency` is reached. [default: "10 ns"]

      --use-cpu-pinning <bool>
          Pin each thread and any processes it executes to the same logical CPU Core to improve
          cache affinity [default: true]

      --use-dynamic-runahead <bool>
          Update the minimum runahead dynamically throughout the simulation. [default: false]

      --use-memory-manager <bool>
          Use the MemoryManager in memory-mapping mode. This can improve performance, but disables
          support for dynamically spawning processes inside the simulation (e.g. the `fork`
          syscall). [default: false]

      --use-new-tcp <bool>
          Use the rust TCP implementation [default: false]

      --use-object-counters <bool>
          Count object allocations and deallocations. If disabled, we will not be able to detect
          object memory leaks [default: true]

      --use-preload-libc <bool>
          Preload our libc library for all managed processes for fast syscall interposition when
          possible. [default: true]

      --use-preload-openssl-crypto <bool>
          Preload our OpenSSL crypto library for all managed processes to skip some crypto
          operations (may speed up simulation if your CPU lacks AES-NI support, but can cause bugs
          so do not use unless you know what you're doing). [default: false]

      --use-preload-openssl-rng <bool>
          Preload our OpenSSL RNG library for all managed processes to mitigate non-deterministic
          use of OpenSSL. [default: true]

      --use-sched-fifo <bool>
          Use the SCHED_FIFO scheduler. Requires CAP_SYS_NICE. See sched(7), capabilities(7)
          [default: false]

      --use-syscall-counters <bool>
          Count the number of occurrences for individual syscalls [default: true]

      --use-worker-spinning <bool>
          Each worker thread will spin in a `sched_yield` loop while waiting for a new task. This is
          ignored if not using the thread-per-core scheduler. [default: true]

If units are not specified, all values are assumed to be given in their base unit (seconds, bytes,
bits, etc). Units can optionally be specified (for example: '1024 B', '1024 bytes', '1 KiB', '1
kibibyte', etc) and are case-sensitive.
