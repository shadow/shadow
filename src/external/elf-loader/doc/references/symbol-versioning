ELF Symbol Versioning


The symbol versioning implementation used on Linux with glibc 2.1 or
up is an extension of Sun's versioning.  It provides most of the
functionality Sun has plus one decisive new element: symbol-level
versioning with multiple definitions of a symbol.


The implementation allows every DSO to either use versions for their
symbols or not.  Depending on whether the DSO an object is linked
against had symbols or not, the reference to the DSO requires symbols
or not.  This is recorded in the binary by three new sections:

- SHT_GNU_verdef

  This section is pointed to by an entry in the section table with the tag
  DT_VERDEF.  It points to a table with elements of type Elfxx_Verdef.
  The number of entries in the table is determined by DT_VERDEFNUM.  GNU
  ld generated sections with the name '.gnu.version_d'.  The link in the
  section header points to the section with the strings used in the entries
  of this section.

  Elfxx_Verdef is defined as:

typedef struct
{
  Elfxx_Half	vd_version;		/* Version revision */
  Elfxx_Half	vd_flags;		/* Version information */
  Elfxx_Half	vd_ndx;			/* Version Index */
  Elfxx_Half	vd_cnt;			/* Number of associated aux entries */
  Elfxx_Word	vd_hash;		/* Version name hash value */
  Elfxx_Word	vd_aux;			/* Offset in bytes to verdaux array */
  Elfxx_Word	vd_next;		/* Offset in bytes to next verdef
					   entry */
} Elfxx_Verdef;

  The meaning of the individual fields is as follows:

  vd_version
    This field currently always has the value 1.  It will be changed if
    the versioning implementation has to be changed in an incompatible
    way.

  vd_flags
    This field contains a bitmask of flags.  The following value is
    defined so far:

      VER_FLG_BASE    this is the version of the file itself.  It must
                      not be used for matching a symbol.  It can be used
                      to match references.

  vd_ndx
    This is a numeric value which is used as an index into the SHT_GNU_versym
    section.

  vd_cnt
    The element specifies the number of associated auxiliary entries.  These
    auxiliary entries contain the actual version definition.

  vd_hash
    Hash value of the name (computed using the ELF hash function)

  vd_aux
    Offset in bytes to the corresponding auxiliary entries.

  vd_next
    Offset in bytes to the next version definition


  The entries referenced to by the vd_aux elements are of this type:

typedef struct
{
  Elfxx_Word	vda_name;		/* Version or dependency names */
  Elfxx_Word	vda_next;		/* Offset in bytes to next verdaux
					   entry */
} Elfxx_Verdaux;

  vda_name
    This is an index into the string section referenced in the section
    header to the point where the name string can be found.

  vda_next
    byte offset to the next Elfxx_Verdaux entry.  The first entry (pointed
    to by the Elfxx_Verdef entry, contains the actual defined name.  The
    second and all later entries name predecessor versions.


- SHT_GNU_verneed

  This section is pointed to by an entry in the section table with the tag
  DT_VERNEED.  It points to a table with elements of type Elfxx_Verneed.
  The number of entries in the table is determined by DT_VERNEEDNUM.  GNU
  ld generated sections with the name '.gnu.version_r'.  The link in the
  section header points to the section with the strings used in the entries
  of this section.

  Elfxx_Verneed is defined as:

typedef struct
{
  Elfxx_Half	vn_version;		/* Version of structure */
  Elfxx_Half	vn_cnt;			/* Number of associated aux entries */
  Elfxx_Word	vn_file;		/* Offset of filename for this
					   dependency */
  Elfxx_Word	vn_aux;			/* Offset in bytes to vernaux array */
  Elfxx_Word	vn_next;		/* Offset in bytes to next verneed
					   entry */
} Elfxx_Verneed;

  The meaning of the individual fields is as follows:

  vn_version
    This field currently always has the value 1.  It will be changed if
    the versioning implementation has to be changed in an incompatible
    way.

    The symbol VER_NEED_CURRENT is defined for this field.

  vn_cnt
    The element specifies the number of associated auxiliary entries.  These
    auxiliary entries contain the actual version definition.

  vn_file
    Offset in the string section reference by the link in the section header
    for the string with the file name.

  vn_aux
    Offset in bytes to the corresponding auxiliary entries.

  vn_next
    Offset in bytes to the next version dependency record


  The entries referenced to by the vn_aux elements are of this type:

typedef struct
{
  Elfxx_Word	vna_hash;		/* Hash value of dependency name */
  Elfxx_Half	vna_flags;		/* Dependency specific information */
  Elfxx_Half	vna_other;		/* Unused */
  Elfxx_Word	vna_name;		/* Dependency name string offset */
  Elfxx_Word	vna_next;		/* Offset in bytes to next vernaux
					   entry */
} Elfxx_Vernaux;

  vna_hash
    Hash value (computed using the ELF hashing function) for the name
    referenced by vna_name

  vna_flags
   Bitmask of flags.  Currently the following are defined:

     VER_FLG_WEAK	the reference to this version is weak.

  vna_other
    Contains version index unique for the file which is used in the
    version symbol table.  If the highest bit (bit 15) is set this
    is a hidden symbol which cannot be referenced from outside the
    object.

  vna_name
    This is an index into the string section referenced in the section
    header to the point where the name string can be found.

  vna_next
    byte offset to the next Elfxx_Verdaux entry.  The first entry (pointed
    to by the Elfxx_Verdef entry, contains the actual defined name.  The
    second and all later entries name predecessor versions.

- SHT_GNU_versym

  This section contains an array of elements of type Elfxx_Half (the same
  type as the vna_other field).  It has as many entries as the dynamic
  symbol table (DT_SYMTAB).  I.e., each symbol table entry has its
  associated entry in the symbol version table.

  The values in the symbol version table entries are the vna_other values
  from the definition of the required versions.  The values 0 and 1 are
  reserved.

    0   the symbol is local, not available outside the object

    1   the symbol is defined in this object and globally available

  All other values are used for versions in the own object or in any of
  the dependencies.  This is the version the symbol is tight to.  Not the
  numeric value is important but instead the string referenced by the
  vna_name element of the according Elfxx_Verdaux/Elfxx_Vernaux entry.



Startup sequence
================

We describe here only the additional activities required to implement
the versioning in an already existing dynamic loader implementation.
The exact place where the actions have to happen will vary.


After loading a shared object (but before making it generally
available) the dynamic loader has to check whether the loading object
fulfills all the version requirement of the object which caused it to
load.

This has to be done by walking through all the entries of the loading
object's Elfxx_Verneed array and examining whether the loaded object's
Elfxx_Verdef array contains an appropriate version definition.  Both,
the version definition and the version requirement, are identified by
strings.  In both cases the structures contain beside the string (or
string references) also ELF hashing values which can be compared
before making the actual string comparison.

These tests have to be recursively performed for all objects and their
dependencies.  This way it is possible to recognize libraries which
are too old and don't contain all the symbols or contain incompatible
implementations.  Without this kind of test one could end up with
runtime errors which don't provide helpful information.

There is one situation where a missing symbol definition is not an
error.  This is when the vna_flags in the Elfxx_Vernaux entry has the
VER_FLG_WEAK bit set.  In this case only a warning is issued and the
object is used normally.

Once all the tests for availability of the versions are performed
successfully the object can be made available publicly.  If the
loaded objects contains no invalidly formed data this means that all
versions referenced by undefined symbols are available.


Symbol lookup
=============

During the relocations in an object using symbol versioning we have to
extend the test for a matching definition.  Not only is it now
required that the strings with the symbol names are matching, it is
now also required that the version name of the reference is the same
as the name of the definition.  To retrieve the names uses the same
index as for the symbol table (both requirement and definition) and
retrieves a value from the SHT_GNU_versym section.  This section then
can be used to get a string from the Elfxx_Verneed entries (for the
requirement) and the Elfxx_Verdef entries (for the definition).

If the highest bit (no. 15) of the version symbol value is set, the
object is hidden and must not be used.  In this case the linker must
treat the symbol as not present in the object.

Ideally both, the file having the requirement and the file with the
definitions, are using symbol versioning.  In this case the above
matching must happen.  In the case there is no matching definition in
the currently searched object but the object is the one with the name
from the Elfxx_Verneed entry (referenced by the vn_name element), then
the missing of the symbol is a fatal error.  An object must not simply
loose the definition of a symbol.

In case only the object file with the reference does not use
versioning but the object with the definition does, then the reference
only matches the base definition.  The base definition is the one with
index numbers 1 and 2 (1 is the unspecified name, 2 is the name given
later to the baseline of symbols once the library started using symbol
versioning).  The static linker is guaranteed to use this indeces for
the base definition.  If there is no symbol definition with such an
version index and there is exactly one version for which this symbol
is defined, then this version is accepted (this was mostly implemented
for dlopen() calls as it will normally not happen when the static
linker is used).  Otherwise, if more then one version of the symbol is
available, none of the definitions is accepted and the search
continues with the next object.

The last case is if the object with the references uses symbol
versions but the object with the definitions has none.  In this case a
matching symbol is accepted unless the object's name matches the one
in the Elfxx_Verneed entry.  In the latter case this is a fatal error.
In fact, this should never have happened in the first place since it
would mean the list of required symbols was not correct and the steps
required in the last section therefore haven't detected a too old
version of an object file.

The case with two non-versioned object is not new and simply is
resolved according to existing rules.


Static Linker
=============

The static linker has to do some extra work.  It is required to
generate the Elfxx_Verdef and Elfxx_Verneed records as well as the
SHT_GNU_versym section.

The Elfxx_Verdef records are created from information contained in the
object file.  The assembler code contains lines of the form

	.symver real, name@version
or
	.symver real, name@@version

In both cases `real' must be the name of a defined symbol.  The pseudo
opcode generates an alias `name' which is associated with the version
`version'.  There can be arbitrary many definitions of the first kind
but there must be exactly one definition of the later kind.  The two
`at' characters mean that this version is the default version.

Additional input comes from a map file given to the static linker.
The map file also features the version names.  For each version the
programmer can specify whether a given symbol is exported or kept
private.  The .symver definitions must correspond to appropriate
entries in the map file.

Example:

  Assume the definitions

	.symver __foo_old, foo@VER1
	.symver __foo_new, foo@@VER2
	.symver __bar_old, bar@@VER1
	....

  The appropriate map file should look like this:

	VER1 {
	  global:
	    foo; bar;
	  local:
	    *
	};

	VER2 {
	  global:
	    foo;
	} VER1;

  This means:

  - there are two versions defined, VER1, and VER2.  VER2 is a successor
    or VER1 (because of the line `} VER1;'

  - the symbols foo@VER1 and bar@@VER1 are public

  - the symbol foo@@VER2 is also public

  - all other symbols (which are matched by *) are of version VER1 and are
    not exported (which means the version name is irrelevant but it
    somewhere has to be written down)

It makes no sense at all to associate versions with symbols which are
not exported.  Therefore the `local:' sections of all but the base
version are empty and the `local:' section of the base version simply
contains `*'.  This will match all symbols which are not explicitly
mentioned in any `global:' list.

[For more information take a look at Solaris's map files which have a
similar syntax.  It's available in the Linker and Library Guide.]


The difference between a normal version definition and the default
version definition is that when linking against a versioned object one
always picks the default version.  This is normally the latest version
since it is the one currently developed.  Please note that the
undefined reference causing the binding cannot be associated in any
way with a version.  The association happens by finding the first
default definition of a symbol with a matching name.

Once all references needed from a versioned object are identified, the
linker collects all the version names and creates a derivation tree
(it need not be a tree but it should be).  This tree is then put into
the form of an Elfxx_Verneed entry with as many Elfxx_Vernaux entries
as necessary.  The name referenced in the Elfxx_Verneed entry is the
SONAME of the object with the definitions.  All the entries are then
put in the SHT_GNU_verneed section of the newly created object.

In addition the static linker has to create the SHT_GNU_versym section
if the created object contains a DT_SYMTAB section.  It must have the
same number of entries.  Entries which correspond to symbol
definitions in the own file have an index which can be found in an
appropriate entry in the Elfxx_Verdef section.  This entry then gives
access to the version string associated with the symbol by the .symver
pseudo op.  If no version is defined (it always is: all symbols are
defined or none) then the index is 1, meaning global.

In the case the symbol table entry is for an unreferenced symbol the
index is in the Elfxx_Verneed section and it specifies the version
name and the SONAME of the file the definition was found in at
linktime.  If the referenced symbol wasn't satisfied by any of the
archive, objects, or DSOs used on the linker commandline or if the
object the symbol was found in has no symbol versions, the used index
is 1, meaning global.
