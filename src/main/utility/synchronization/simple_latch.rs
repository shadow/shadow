/// waited with [`wait()`](LatchWaiter::wait) on the latch. In other words, you must not call
/// `open()` multiple times without making sure that all waiters have successfully returned from
/// `wait()` each time. This typically requires some other synchronization to make sure that the
/// waiters have waited. If the latch and its waiters aren't kept in sync, the waiters will usually
/// panic, but in some cases may behave incorrectly[^note].
///
/// [^note]: Since this latch uses a 32-bit wrapping integer to track the positions of the latch and
/// its waiters, calling `open()` `u32::MAX + 1` times without allowing the waiters to wait will
/// behave as if you did not call `open()` at all.
