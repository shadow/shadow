//! This module provides several *Context* structs, intended to bundle together
//! current relevant objects in the hierarchy. These are meant to replace
//! `worker_getActiveThread`, etc. Passing around the current context explicitly
//! instead of putting them in globals both allows us to avoid interior mutability
//! (and its associated runtime cost and fallibility), and lets us keep a
//! hierarchical object structure (e.g. allow holding a mutable Process and a
//! mutable Thread belonging to that process simultaneously).
//!
//! Most code (e.g. syscall handlers) can take a `ThreadContext` argument and use
//! that to manipulate anything on the Host. The *current* `Thread` and `Process`
//! should typically be accessed directly. e.g. since a mutable reference to the
//! current `Thread` exists at `ThreadContext::thread`, it *cannot* also be
//! accessible via `ThreadContext::process` or `ThreadContext::host`.
//!
//! The manner in which they're unavailable isn't implemented yet, but the current
//! plan is that they'll be temporarily removed from their collections. e.g. something
//! conceptually like:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! impl Process {
//!     pub fn continue_thread(&mut self, host_ctx: &mut HostContext, tid: ThreadId) {
//!         let thread = self.threads.get_mut(tid).take();
//!         thread.continue(&mut host_ctx.add_process(self));
//!         self.threads.get_mut(tid).replace(thread);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The Context objects are designed to allow simultaneously borrowing from multiple
//! of their objects.  This is currently implemented by exposing their fields
//! directly - Rust then allows each field to be borrowed independently. This could
//! alternatively be implemented by providing methods that borrow some or all of
//! their internal references simultaneously.
