## What is Shadow?

Shadow is a discrete-event network simulator that directly executes real
application code, enabling you to simulate distributed systems with thousands of
network-connected processes in **realistic** and **scalable** private network
experiments using your laptop, desktop, or server running Linux.

Shadow experiments can be scientifically **controlled** and deterministically
**replicated**, making it easier for you to reproduce bugs and eliminate
confounding factors in your experiments.

## How Does Shadow Work?

Shadow directly executes **real applications**:

- Shadow directly executes unmodified, real application code using native OS
  (Linux) processes.
- Shadow co-opts the native processes into a discrete-event simulation by
  interposing at the system call API.
- The necessary system calls are emulated such that the applications need not
  be aware that they are running in a Shadow simulation.

Shadow connects the applications in a **simulated network**:

- Shadow constructs a private, virtual network through which the managed
  processes can communicate.
- Shadow internally implements simulated versions of common network protocols
  (e.g., TCP and UDP).
- Shadow internally models network routing characteristics (e.g., path latency
  and packet loss) using a configurable network graph.

## Why is Shadow Needed?

Network emulators (e.g., [mininet](http://mininet.org)) run real application
code on top of real OS kernels in real time, but are non-determinsitic and have
limited scalability: time distortion can occur if emulated processes exceed an
unknown computational threshold, leading to undefined behavior.

Network simulators (e.g., [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org)) offer more experimental
control and scalability, but have limited application-layer realism because they
run application abstractions in place of real application code.

Shadow offers a novel, hybrid emulation/simulation architecture: it directly
executes real applications as native OS processes in order to faithfully
reproduce application-layer behavior while also co-opting the processes into a
high-performance network simulation that can scale to large distributed systems
with hundreds of thousands of processes.

## Caveats

Shadow implements **over 150 functions from the system call API**, but does not
yet fully support all API features. Although applications that make _basic_ use
of the supported system calls should work out of the box, those that use more
_complex_ features or functions (e.g., `fork()`) may not yet function correctly
when running in Shadow. Extending support for the API is a work-in-progress.

That being said, we are particularly motivated to run large-scale [Tor
Network](https://www.torproject.org) simulations. This use-case is already
fairly well-supported and we are eager to continue extending support for it.

## Quickstart

Build, test, and install Shadow into `~/.local`:
```
$ ./setup build --clean --test
$ ./setup test
$ ./setup install
```
